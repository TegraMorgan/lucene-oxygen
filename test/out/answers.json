The common cold never kills anyone, unless they are so debilitated that anything at all would knock them off.  And it is merely a minor inconvenience most of the time.

I\u0027m sure the drug companies would love to sell a pill or nasal spray to cure the cold, as they would make billions.

Dry hands tend to be dull-looking, flaky, scaly and cracked, and it easily develops fine lines and wrinkles. The skin often feels tight and dry, especially after immersion in water unless immediately covered with moisturizer or skin cream. Chapping may also occur. . . The most annoying symptom of eczema is constant, uncontrollable itching. Eczema on the hands looks like scaly, thickened areas of skin that can become red and fissured. Tiny blisters that weep, rupture and crust over are also common with eczema.. . Combat dry hands by drinking at least two quarts of water every day and eating a balanced diet (with plenty of vegetables, fruits, grains, seeds and nuts). Avoid fried foods, animal fats, soft drinks, sugar, chocolate, snack chips, alcohol and caffeine, because these items tend to rob the body of necessary fluids and minerals. . . Do not use harsh soaps or very hot water when bathing, showering or washing dishes. Use a loofah sponge twice a week on the affected areas to increase circulation and remove dead skin. Moisturize your hands after cleansing and several other times during the day to avoid dryness. Use calendula cream or oil with comfrey, vitamin E oil and aloe vera on the fingers at bedtime, then wear plastic or cotton gloves overnight.

Because food allergies are a major cause of eczema, it is important to consult with a doctor to determine if allergies are a factor.

      "answer": "Joey---- That is just stupid, the ingrediants are not burnt. . . And is more of a Ruby color when you hold it up to light.. . Guiness is a light porter, if there are plenty of dark beers out there not just guiness. Porters, stouts, and other deep black beers are the most popular type. If you want a more detailed explanation of WHY it is black, take a trip to www.beeradvocate.com. . Here is an exert from a recent interview with Fergal Murray, a guiness brewaster. . \"A lot of Guinness lovers swear the beer’s color has recently changed from black to ruby red. Murray insisted otherwise; rather, only certain types of glassware (like the company’s own narrow-bottomed vessels), he said, truly showcase the beer’s ruby hue.\". . Most Americans look at Stout as a thick, murky, \"eat it with a spoon\" beer. It is also a common misconception that these black beers are more potent, simply due to their appearance. Plenty of Bostonians see it as a nitro forced black beverage and happily quaff down several pints a night with out a second thought, usually a Guinness Draught or Murphy\u0027s. Guinness has less alcohol than Budweiser, around 4.2% alcohol by volume (on tap, 4.1% draught can, in the US) which would explain why everyone can drink so much of it, so quickly, and why it has become a popular session beer. But, here\u0027s a little Stout 101 for the novices, for those that might want to switch things up a bit: We have all been to one of the many Irish pubs in the area, and friends or co-workers talk in awe about Guinness and how it is the best stout, if not beer, in the world. Not entirely true. The modern day Guinness \"on draught version\" is definitely the best selling Stout in the world, but there\u0027s more to the story.. . There are many variations of the stout beer style. Some are dry and some are sweet, some hoppy and some alcoholic. All have that common characteristic of a roasted flavour that sets them apart from any other style. Usually this roasted character comes from the use of roasted barley, which is barley grain that has not been malted, but rather highly kilned. The process imparts a uniqueness to the grain and creates flavours ranging from bitter unsweetened chocolate to coffee, to a dry grain astringency.. . In the late 1600\u0027s to early 1700\u0027s, the term \"stout\" was often used to reference a strong beer. When the term actually became a style is up for interpretation, however, what we do know is that back in the late 1700\u0027s, when Guinness was first brewing what was then called its Porter, it was not brewing the light bodied easy to suck down creamy stout that most imbibers enjoy today. It was a dark murky looking brew, standing, roughly, a whopping 7.5% abv. Guinness first brewed a strong export style to be shipped to the Caribbean, an Export / Foreign Stout, hence the name Guinness Foreign Export Strong Porter (later to be called, Foreign Extra Stout). It had a very complex, huge body, big hop profile and an intense robust character. You can still purchase it today -- and it\u0027s very much brewed the same way -- but only in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.. . In the very late 1700\u0027s, some English breweries produced an export stout, similar to a foreign export, specifically for the Baltic area. This variation was called a Russian Imperial Stout. Brewed to an extreme strength, around 8-11% abv, and conditioned for months, even aged for years before consumption, these brews were quite popular within the Russian Imperial Court. The closest rendition of this brew is A. Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout imported by B. United International. Others include: North Coast\u0027s Old Rasputin Imperial Stout, Smuttynose Imperial Stout, Sam Smith Imperial Stout and Rogue Imperial Stout.. . One of the most common stouts, Dry Irish Stout, can be any where from 3.5-5.5% abv, with a moderate body to keep it on the drinkable side. They\u0027re usually a lower carbonation brew and serv",

      "answer": "Israel nuclear programme commenced in 1958, it was with help of US that a nuclear-armed Israel was founded. In 1969 -- a crucial time in which international ratification of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was uncertain and U.S. policymakers feared that a Middle Eastern conflagration could lead to superpower conflict. Nearly four decades later, as the world struggles with nuclear ambitions in Iran, India and elsewhere, the ramifications of this hidden history are still felt. In 1958, Israel secretly initiated work at what was to become the  Dimona nuclear research site. Only about 15 years after the Holocaust, nuclear nonproliferation norms did not yet exist, and Israel\u0027s founders believed they had a compelling case for acquiring nuclear weapons. In 1961, the CIA estimated that Israel could produce nuclear weapons within the decade.. From the perspective of U.S. policymakers, Israel was a small, friendly state -- albeit one outside the boundaries of U.S. security guarantees -- surrounded by larger enemies vowing to destroy it. Yet few government officials also saw the Israeli nuclear program as a potential threat to U.S. interests. President John F. Kennedy feared that without decisive international action to curb nuclear proliferation, a world of 20 to 30 nuclear-armed nations would be inevitable within a decade or two.. . The Kennedy and Johnson administrations fashioned a complex scheme of annual visits to Dimona to ensure that Israel would not develop nuclear weapons. But, by late 1966, Israel had reached the nuclear threshold, although it decided not to conduct an atomic test.. By the time Prime Minister Levi Eshkol visited President Lyndon B. Johnson in January 1968, the official State Department view was that despite Israel\u0027s growing nuclear weapons potential, it had \"not embarked on a program to produce a nuclear weapon.\" That assessment, however, eroded in the months ahead. By the fall, Assistant Defense Secretary Paul C. Warnke concluded that Israel had already acquired the bomb when Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin explained to him how he interpreted Israel\u0027s pledge not to be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the region. According to Rabin, for nuclear weapons to be introduced, they needed to be tested and publicly declared. Implicitly, then, Israel could possess the bomb without \"introducing\" it.",

Liberals, and organizations like the ACLU, have been against EVERY SINGLE MEANS of enhancing our security:  increased border patrols, no fly lists, NSA monitoring of international calls to suspected Al Qaeda members, the Patriot Act, etc.. . If it were left up to nutcases like the ACLU, we wouldn\u0027t even have a Cub Scout troop defending us.. . The problem with these peoples\u0027 reasoning is this:  they always cite theoretical, potential future abuses of power.  Most people will admit the government has the authority to monitor calls placed to suspected terrorists.  Not doing this would be completely irresponsible.  Remember, we are in war.. . These critics suffer from what I term, \"The Sci-Fi Syndrome\".  The best sci-fi gives us a vision of the future if one aspect of society goes terribly wrong (massive overpopulation; worldwide disease epidemic; excessive global warming or a sudden ice age, etc.)  In the same way, these critics of how we are defending this country are usually based on these \"sci-fi fears\".  They say, \"Oh, well maybe the government currently is only monitoring call PATTERNS, or using a computer program to redlist calls to suspected AlQaeda members overseas.........BUT, what happens if they start eavesdropping on our actual phone calls?\". . Well, the government isn\u0027t listening to our innocent, domestic phone calls to Aunt Sally.  George Bush does not sit in the Oval Office hoping to hear some juicy gossip from Fred Smith of Pocataw, New Jersey.. . Remember, a President\u0027s highest obligation to the country is to defend it against attack.  He is doing just that.  How else would you want the war on terror to be conducted?. .

An aurora happens when particles from the sun cause the earth’s upper atmosphere to act like a big neon sign.  Let me explain.  In a neon sign, an electric current runs through a wire into a glass tube filled with gas to make different colors of light.  The color depends on the kind of gas  .  The same thing can happen high above the earth.  Electrically charged particles speeding away from the sun (called the “solar wind”) are captured by  earth’s magnetic field and collide with atmospheric gases. Different gases give off different colored light. Since the earth’s magnetic field directs the charged particles toward the north and south poles, the colors are usually most vivid there. . . But sometimes the sun can release big bursts of energy. When these huge concentrations of charged particles reach earth, auroras can be visible much farther away from the poles.",

      "answer": "(Dolby, Optical, etc) Digital vs. Analog (Stereo). . Biggest difference is the price... however, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what you intended... storage medium for digital has already been picked apart.. . Stereo is as optimal a soundstage as you\u0027ll be able to reproduce when listening to music.  Face it music was mixed by a technition in a studio, with a mixing console, and panning fader deciding which side the bass guitar should be on, placement of vocals to the center of the stage, and the location of all the instruments within that stereo stage.. . With the left and right channel played through a turn table, coupled to a preamp, through the EQ, fired to the amplifier, and out to the staged speakers is going give most audiophiles a good run for their money.  Taking into consideration, they likely just dished out $20k + for their gear.  Not to mention the phase aligning power cleaners, balanced cables, and cost to replace tubes... and the days upon days spent reorganizing their space for acoustic perfection.. . Digitial on the flip side, is somewhat of a loaded word.  This has been established above, and can be applied to just about anything to do with electronics.  However, it could be stated that the staging effects of digital in comparison to a good 2 channel stage, directly opposed to using rear fill satellites with a full left, right, center, and the mono sub channel, just creates a mess when you\u0027re applying room acoustics to the ambient demands of music reproduction.  Digital in this display gets the crap kicked out of it over stereo for ambient staging reproduction simplicity for an average system. However, for home theatre full room ambience, a good staged multi-channel arrangment runs circles around stereo.. . Stereo in this respect can reproduce music wonderfully and accurately, while still producing a modest mind blowing theatre experience with a powerful enough system.  Whereas, Digital systems tend to rely on the fill effects in relation to their small size to create the same ambience produced by the Stereo speakers.  The problem with this, rear fill just doesn\u0027t work well hwen playing music.  Nobody stands backwards at a rock concert, this is also a common problem with car audio, when people overdrive the rear fills, it dissrupts the front channels ability to create a proper stage.  The result is something that sounds unnatural. . . With that said, digital on it\u0027s own can\u0027t survive with analog, but analog can survive without digital.  Besides, there is no such thing as a true digital amplifier, as even the Class D (commonly mislabelled) is still using a majority of it\u0027s circuitry based on analog designs.  Though, Digital Effects Processors are capable of splitting, resampling, and converting an analog source to digital, it still has to pass through a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) so it can be sent to the analog speakers.. . Mixing the two... Digital reproduction is considered even by hardened audiophiles over analog, as a source, to be capable of cleanly reproducing music in ways analog could only dream of.  Mainly, you don\u0027t have the elevated tape hiss, the pops and scratches of vinyl, and the annoyance of 8-track splitting the mix half-way through your favourite song.  But!!! The analog recordings are as true tonally to the original as any medium can get, and unfortunately digital recordings fail in comparison.  They are also considered tonally harsher because the sound signal has to be converted from a square and reinterpolated back to an analog wave.  During this conversion, information is either lost, or open to interpretation.  Hence the problems with bitrates, the heated arguments over OGG, MP4, WMA, etc... . . There\u0027s still problems with this, as the benefits that analog sources provide over digital are truthfully wasted on the average person.

      "answer": "Unfortunately you are not telling the real stories ! . Let me start from the beginning.. # Example 1.  The Piltdown man skull was not forged by an evolutionist but from an amateur British archeologist Charles Dawson (1864–1916) who was credited or blamed with discoveries that turned out to be imaginative frauds.. The so called Piltdown man skull was the subject of controversy until it was exposed in 1953 as a forgery by a group of real scientists!. . # Example 2. Nebraska Man: A Pig\u0027s Tooth. Let me tell you the real facts: . In 1917, rancher and geologist Harold Cook collected a human-looking tooth in Pliocene (recently redesignated Miocene) sediments in northwestern Nebraska. In March 1922, Cook submitted the specimen to Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of Natural History who mistakenly identified it as anthropoid. (Osborn, 1922b, p. 2) One month later, Osborn announced Hesperopithecus haroldcookii as the first anthropoid ape from America. But there was great controversy by other scientists.. Actually VERY FEW SCIENTISTS claimed Nebraska Man was a human ancestor. Some, (including Osborn and his colleagues) identified it only as an advanced primate of some kind. Most others were skeptical even of that. It is not true that Nebraska Man was widely accepted as an ape-man, or even as an ape, by scientists, and its effect upon the scientific thinking of the time was negligible. For example, in his two-volume \"Human Origins\" (1924), George MacCurdy dismissed Nebraska Man in a single footnote:. \"In 1920 [sic], Osborn described two molars from the Pliocene of Nebraska; he attributed these to an anthropoid primate to which he has given the name Hesperopithecus. The teeth are not well preserved, so that the validity of Osborn\u0027s determination has not yet been generally accepted.\" . Creationists often claim that Nebraska Man was used as proof of evolution during the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925, but this claim is apocryphal. No scientific evidence was presented at the trial. (Some evidence was read into the trial record, but even this did not refer to Nebraska Man.). Nebraska Man should not be considered an embarrassment to science. The scientists involved were mistaken, and somewhat incautious, but not incompetent or dishonest. The whole episode was actually an excellent example of the scientific process working at its best. Given a problematic identification, scientists investigated further, found data which falsified their earlier ideas, and promptly abandoned them (a marked contrast to the creationist approach).. . # Example 3. The Ota Benga man was not discovered by an evolutionist researcher as you said!!! (sic!!) but instead it was an American missionary Samuel Phillips Verner who actually met Ota Benga in 1904, in what was then the Belgian Congo. Verner had been sent to Africa under contract from the St. Louis World\u0027s Fair to bring back pygmies for exhibition. He negotiated with a tribal slave trader and returned to the U.S. with Ota Benga and eight others. After several months of travel in the U.S., Verner took Ota Benga to the Bronx Zoo in New York City in 1906 in hopes of finding him a place to live. At first, the young man was allowed to roam the grounds and help feed the animals. Then, socialite and amateur anthropologist Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society, had Ota Benga put on display at the zoo alongside the apes and other animals. Zoo director W.H. Hornaday decided to use Ota Benga as a public attraction. At the behest of Grant, a prominent scientific racist and eugenicist, Hornaday placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him \"the missing link\" in an attempt to illustrate human evolution, and in particular that Africans like Ota Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. NOT EVEN ONE SCIENTIST OR EVOLUTIONIST ever agreed to this display or ever agreed that he was nothing more than a display and a clever trick of a zo",

      "answer": "Wicca is a henotheistic religion, which recognises its own specific gods, while not denying the existence of gods and goddesses from other pantheons. Wicca itself is a \u0027hard polytheistic\u0027 religion, meaning that Wicca see their deities as specific individual beings. The gods of Wicca are known as the Horned God and Great Mother, these are outer court references meant to be used as place holders for the real names of their gods until the Seeker is initiated and taught those names. . . Wicca was founded by Gerald Gardner in around the 1930\u0027s, although the exact date is open for discussion, also open for discussion is whether Gardner founded Wicca entirely or whether it was an already existing spirituality which he merely re-introduced and re-invented, either way he is considered the founding father of Wicca. Gardner brought together Paganism with influences from many sources including the rituals and teachings of Freemasonry and Golden dawn resulting in a unique orthopraxic religion. Wicca embraces it\u0027s early Pagan roots in history, the history of Pagan faiths and the gods whom they followed and worshipped, Wicca also introduces eastern philosophy into it\u0027s primarily western path, along with this possibly one of Wicca\u0027s best known features, that of religious witchcraft.. . Wicca is gaining much attention due to a change in peoples approach to religion and the increase in public awareness of the religion through media attention and with this attention there has come much change to the face of Wicca with many forms:. . . WICCA:. Wicca is an initiate only mystery tradition, or more precisely a priesthood, where one can trace their lineage back to Gardner. Initiation is the only way into Wicca, and is carried out by a Wicca coven, initiation into a coven requires formal training after which initiation and a system of degrees is followed. . . Wicca follows a strong set of doctrines, one who takes on the name \u0027Wicca\u0027 is also taking on these doctrines as well as practices and beliefs of Wicca, the title of \u0027Wicca\u0027 implies more than that you are a member of Wicca, but also that you have worked long and hard to earn that title. . Seekers are those who wish to become Wicca however have yet to find a Wicca coven. Wicca covens can be hard to find let alone become a member of, often those whom are without a coven continue to study Wicca and surrounding subjects while seeking a Wicca coven to join. . . Often Wicca is described as \u0027Traditional Wicca\u0027 or \u0027BTW:British Traditional Wicca\u0027.. . . NEO-WICCA:. Neo-wicca is a new phenomenon, which is usually wholly eclectic, however like Wicca there are various different traditions. Neo-wicca often learn on their own terms, from books and other sources, but have little or no formal training and no initiation into Wicca. The beliefs of Neo-wicca are generally similar to that of Wicca however the details can often vary greatly as it follows the new age idea of personal belief/spirituality over formal religious doctrine. Neo-Wicca have varied views of the divine, either following soft-polytheism seeing all gods and goddesses as one god/goddess, polytheism working with gods and goddesses from various pantheons or pantheism working with a single divine present in all.. . The \u0027Neo\u0027 in Neo-wicca refers to the New Age approach taken by Neo-wicca that puts emphasis on personal spirituality or belief over the organized religion of Wicca. It also refers to a new take on Wicca, this has less to do with the age of the religion but the idea that this is a belief system which may have come naturally from Wicca if it was allowed to evolve in it’s own time, media influences have brought about Neo-wicca, it develops paralleled to Wicca, but is not part of Wicca. . . Often Neo-wicca describe themselves as \u0027Eclectic Wicca\u0027 or \u0027Solitary Wicca\u0027, although not actually Wicca. . . . Although Wicca is heavily influenced or based upon witchcraft it ",

      "answer": "This is an extremely serious condition for a cat.  The result of not treating it swiftly can be deafness for the cat.. . I got my cat from a friend of a friend who owned a farm.  She was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general. When I got her she had this black gunk in both her ears.. . I took her to the vet almost as soon as I got her, so I could get her shots and get her registered, checked out, and her checked out and find out anything I should know as a cat owner.  She was the first cat I had ever owned.. . He said the black stuff was ear mites and gave me some stuff for that.  I dutifully put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it.  The result was her ears got clean and stayed that way forever.  She suffered no loss of hearing as far as I can tell.  She comes when I call her name, just like a dog, in fact!. . My mom had a cat which she got from a shelter.  Eventually it passed on to my brother.  Before, it had been an indoor cat.  My brother decided it should be an outdoor cat.  At some point, the cat must have gotten ear mites.  Not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards.  Whichever it was, the mite infestation must not have been caught and treated in time.  . . The cat is quite deaf.  It never responds when being called, even to look, when you are right there in the room with it.  It does not respond to loud noises at all, either.. . I know the annual checkups you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shots, some of which they do not need every year anyway.  For example, my cat gets a 3 year rabies shot - so it does not need one every year.  So most years, the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one.. . If you are sure that the condition is caused by ear mites and you cannot afford to take the cat to the vet right now, at least get the medicine right away and apply it as directed.  I just looked, and PetSmart carries it.  There is probably a PetSmart near you and if not, it looks like you can order it from their web site.  It only costs $10.49 today.. . According to the second Source I have listed (kittencare.com) the mites could have moved from your cat to your house.  It sounds like they might move back again.  You might want to be on guard for that.. . I really encourage you to talk to a vet.. . Like I said, though both my cat and my brother\u0027s/mother\u0027s cat had the same condition - my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf.  The only difference was in the treatment they received.. . If you must skip the visit to the vet, or delay it, do not delay treating the ear mites at all!  Get the medicine for it and carefully use it as directed.. . Make sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cats ears with outside as well.  Do not bring it back in your house to throw it away.  Do not wipe your cats ears inside. You might wipe the mites onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside.. . I am including a couple more links just so you will have more sources of information at your fingertips.  Might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away, without second thoughts or wishing you had more information.. . Good luck with the treatment and I hope your kitty gets well!. . The first step is spotting the mites and recognizing what they are, not just thinking it is dirt.. . You have done that, so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do.. . Make sure you hold your cat\u0027s head perfectly still while you apply the stuff.  Do not go in too far, either.. . She should be fine if you have caught the problem in time.",

So, ID3 was born. . . ID3 is a small piece of information stored physically inside the MP3 file (in the beginning or in the end of the file, depends on ID3\u0027s version). ID3 tags (as the pieces of information that ID3s contain are called) can contain various information about the MP3, like album name, song name, artist, original artist, genre, composer, releasing year, additional comment fields, etc.. Nowadays ID3s are de facto in audio world and they can be added to most of the audio formats and even to certain video formats in order to provide additional information of the file.",

HAHAHAHHA research research and research somemore... if you don\u0027t know anything about turbos... don\u0027t do it learn and then do it... to turbo your car its gonna cost you at least $4,000-$5,000! for parts! thats not even including tuning and installation! so yeah really consider it before you just start buying odd pieces here and there... and oh yeah don\u0027t waste your money on any of those stupid bolt ons! they all get replaced with something far more superior with the same price tag... about anyways... well i hope this has given you some insight into what seems cool at first and becomes a problem later...",

Thus, the radius decreases.. . 2. happens because as you go down a group, you add electrons to higher shells. these shells are further out from the nucleus (on average) and thus the atomic radius increases.. . The factors that determine atomic radius also determine electronegativity, therfore flourine is also the most electronegative atom.

      "answer": "Telemedicine . The term Telemedicine is the delivery of medicine at a distance. The term is composed of the Greek word τελε (tele) meaning \u0027far\u0027, and medicine. Telemedicine may be as simple as two health professionals discussing a case over the telephone, or as complex as using satellite technology and video-conferencing equipment to conduct a real-time consultation between medical specialists in two different countries.. . Telemedicine generally refers to the use of communications and information technologies for the delivery of clinical care.. . Care at a distance (also called in absentia care), is an old practice which was often conducted via post; there has been a long and successful history of in absentia health care, which - thanks to modern communication technology - has metamorphosised into what we know as modern telemedicine.. . In its early manifestations, African villagers used smoke signals to warn people to stay away from the village in case of serious disease. In the early 1900s, people living in remote areas in Australia used two-way radios, powered by a dynamo driven by a set of bicycle pedals, to communicate with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.. . The terms e-health and telehealth are at times wrongly interchanged with telemedicine. Like the terms \"medicine\" and \"health care\", telemedicine often refers only to the provision of clinical services while the term telehealth can refer to clinical and non-clinical services such as medical education, administration, and research. The term e-health is often, particularly in the U.K. and Europe, used as an umbrella term that includes telehealth, electronic medical records, and other components of health IT.. . . Types of Telemedicine. Telemedicine is practised on the basis of two concepts: real time (synchronous) and store-and-forward (asynchronous).. . Real time telemedicine could be as simple as a telephone call or as complex as robotic surgery. It requires the presence of both parties at the same time and a communications link between them that allows a real-time interaction to take place. Video-conferencing equipment is one of the most common forms of technologies used in synchronous telemedicine. There are also peripheral devices which can be attached to computers or the video-conferenceing equipment which can aid in an interactive examination. For instance, an otoscope allows a physician to \u0027see\u0027 inside a patient\u0027s ear; a stethoscope allows the consulting physician to hear the patient\u0027s heartbeat. Medical specialties conducive to this kind of consultation include psychiatry, internal medicine, rehabilitation, cardiology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology and neurology.. . Store-and-forward telemedicine involves acquiring medical data (like medical images, bio-signals etc) and then transmitting this data to a doctor or medical specialist at a convenient time for assessment offline. It does not require the presence of both parties at the same time. Dermatology, radiology, and pathology are common specialties that are condusive to asynchronous telemedicine.. . Telemedicine is most beneficial for populations living in isolated communities and remote regions and is currently being applied in virtually all medical domains. Specialties that use telemedicine often use a \"tele-\" prefix; for example, telemedicine as applied by radiologists is called Teleradiology. Similarly telemedicine as applied by cardiologists is termed as telecardiology, etc.. . . See also. Medicine . Health . In absentia health care . Telehealth . . Resources.

Often calling from VoIP user to VoIP user is free, and you pay a monthly fee that is way less than the regular telephone company to make calls from your VoIP line to the regular land lines.. . Voice over Internet Protocol (also called VoIP, IP Telephony, Internet telephony, and Digital Phone) is the routing of voice conversations over the Internet or any other IP-based network. The voice data flows over a general-purpose packet-switched network, instead of traditional dedicated, circuit-switched voice transmission lines.. . Protocols used to carry voice signals over the IP network are commonly referred to as Voice over IP or VoIP protocols. They may be viewed as commercial realizations of the experimental Network Voice Protocol (1973) invented for the ARPANET.. . Voice over IP traffic might be deployed on any IP network, including ones lacking a connection to the rest of the Internet, for instance on a private building-wide LAN.. In general, phone service via VoIP costs less than equivalent service from traditional sources. Some cost savings are due to using a single network to carry voice and data, especially where users have existing under-utilized network capacity they can use for VoIP at no additional cost. One must note that the maximum upstream in your Internet connection is the final throttle and service is not as good as standard telco services. VoIP phone calls (even international) are widely regarded as free. While there is a cost for their Internet service, using VoIP over this service usually does not involve any extra charges, so the users view the calls as free. There are a number of services that have sprung up to facilitate this type of \"free\" VoIP call. Examples are Google Talk, Skype, TheGlobe, Callserve and Yahoo Messenger.. . Functionality. . VoIP makes easy some things that are difficult with traditional phone networks:. .     * Incoming phone calls can be automatically routed to your VoIP phone, irrespective of where you are connected to the network. Take your VoIP phone with you on a trip, and anywhere you connect it to the Internet, you can receive your incoming calls..     * Call center agents using VoIP phones can work from anywhere with a sufficiently fast Internet connection..     * VoIP phones can integrate with other services available over the Internet, including video conversation, message or data file exchange in parallel with the conversation, audio conferencing, managing address books and passing information about whether others (e.g. friends or colleagues) are available online to interested parties.. . . .

Management is always seeing new faces and always having to arrange for new ones to be trained. It also does not help that a person can be hired for this job so young that some of them are still attending highschool. The turn over rate is one reason why (a big reason, actually) the Nursing Assistants are not offered as big of a benefit package...or a comparible pay rate...as the Nurses. And, even though there are some unbeatable CNA\u0027s out there who deserve so much more than what they receive, let\u0027s face it...a lot of them do continually gripe about how bad their job sucks, and rarely have anything good to say about it. They may think this doesn\u0027t get back to management, but it most always does. If not their exact words, at least their attitude will.

It is a very Australian phenomenon, and I\u0027ve never seen it anywhere else. . . There is a cultural twist to taking the piss that is hard to explain if you\u0027ve never experienced it. Making fun of someone suggets that there is some cruelty intended on the part of the agressor. It also suggests the people involved don\u0027t like each other. Australian piss taking  has no real element of cruelty, and the people involved usually HAVE to like each other. You are required to take the piss out of your best mate, you might take the piss out of someone you just met who you are gettingon well with, but you would never ever take the  piss out of someone you dislike (at least not while they were in the room).. . The closest American equivalent is the \"Yo Momma\" joke. The rules are never expressed formally, but it\u0027s the job of the person taking the piss to try to irritate, insult or humiliate the victim. And the victims \u0027wins\u0027 if he ignores it. He scores even more points if he can turn it back on the piss taker.. . If you just substitute \"making fun\" for \"taking the  piss\" you\u0027ll get the general meaning.

The spirit realm is where things like angels, demons, spiritual alters are and work.. . Facts about the spirit realm:. . 1. It is more powerful than one\u0027s ability to make decisions. If there are things in the spirit realm that says that \"your family must suffer from divorce or unsuccessful relationships\", then it will happen no matter how nice you are to the girls you meet.. . 2. The spirit realm influences the outcome of results of things no matter how clever or mature you are. There are many clever people who could not get anywhere in life until we prayed a prayer of deliverance in the Name of Jesus on them.. . 3. Before things happen in the physical, they had already been set in the spirit realm. This does not mean, God has already decided to take people to hell or heaven. You go to your destination based on how you respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ.. . 4. There is someone who is in charge of hurting people in the spirit realm, Satan and his angels. He likes it when people do not think he exists! No one will run to protection until one knows that one\u0027s enemy exists!. . 5. There is someone who wants you to have healthy relationships with your partner more than you can imagine... Jesus Christ.. . 6. There is someone who is able to turn the spirit realm to favour you...Jesus Christ... But you will have to play by His rules.. . Secret, sometimes people make decisions in their lives without to know that the spirit realm influenced them to take such decisions. They sometimes even falsely think experience made them make the decisions they made or what they were taught in their up-bringing. While this may be true, there is a world that many people think does not exist, but it does and rules the outcome of things on earth no matter how much people know what is good for them.. .

The Check Engine light is telling you that there is something wrong with your vehicle\u0027s emission control system.  As mentioned by others, it could be a loose gas cap, a bad spark plug or wire, a malfunctioning Oxygen Sensor,or any number of things.  There is only a few hundred things that can trigger the light to come on.  . . Get it scanned and find out which error code is causing the light, and go from there.  I would not trust the parts stores to scan it since you probably won\u0027t get a knowledgeable answer as far as to what the problem may be.  Yes you may be able to swap a component or two, but unless they are familiar with OBD II and how to properly use the scanner, you are better off taking the car to someone who knows what they are doing with it.  The money you save on unnecessary parts and frustration is better spent on an experienced diagnosis and solution, not some guy who works a parts counter and reads the code description out of a little handbook.. .

      "answer": "Do you know how to edit your hosts file?  Most effective!  There are also apps you can use to do this for you, but I prefer to edit the hosts file on my own.  Here is how;. . What it does .... The Hosts file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. This file is loaded into memory (cache) at startup, then Windows checks the Hosts file before it queries any DNS servers, which enables it to override addresses in the DNS. This prevents access to the listed sites by redirecting any connection attempts back to the local machine. Another feature of the HOSTS file is its ability to block other applications from connecting to the Internet, providing the entry exists.. . You can use a HOSTS file to block ads, banners, 3rd party Cookies, 3rd party page counters, web bugs, and even most hijackers. This is accomplished by blocking the Server that supplies these little gems. . . Example - the following entry 127.0.0.1 ad.doubleclick.net blocks all files supplied by that DoubleClick Server to the web page you are viewing. This also prevents the server from tracking your movements. Why? ... because in certain cases \"Ad Servers\" like Doubleclick will try to open a separate connection on the webpage you are viewing. . . For XP SP2 users you should see a Security Center prompt about allowing this connection.  . Simply click No and continue. Yes the prompts can be annoying but at least you\u0027ll know.. Note: this prompt only occurs if *.doubleclick.net is included in the \"Restricted Zone\".. . More Examples.  AdTech |  BridgeTrack |  Honesty |  Mgnetwork |  ValueClick | Google AdSense | Atdmt. Now here is a 3rd party ad server opening a connection to another 3rd party ad server - Ad-Flow. . Note: By placing these type sites in the Restricted Zone this also cures most \"Back Button\" issues.. . Now includes most major parasites, hijackers and unwanted Search Engines!. Proudly now the #1 rated HOSTS file on the Internet!  - Google | MSN | Yahoo | AltaVista. Now featured on the Kim Komando Radio Show. The MVPS HOSTS file has been selected by Pricelessware as \"the best of the best in Freeware\". . http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.zip. . In many cases using a well designed HOSTS file can speed the loading of web pages by not having to wait for these ads, annoying banners, hit counters, etc. to load. This also helps to protect your Privacy and Security by blocking sites that may track your viewing habits, also known as  \"click-thru tracking\" or Data Miners. Simply using a HOSTS file is not a cure-all against all the dangers on the Internet, but it does provide another effective \"Layer of Protection\".. . Editors Note: As time has progressed the focus of this project has changed from just blocking ads/banners to protecting the user from the many parasites that now exist on the Internet. It doesn\u0027t serve much purpose if you block the ad banner from displaying as most other HOSTS files do, but get hijacked by a parasite from an evil exploit or download contained on the web site. The object is to surf faster while preserving your Safety, Security and Privacy. . .  To view the HOSTS file in plain text form. (454 kb) (opens in IE). Note: The text version also makes a terrific reference for determining possible culprit sites. . HOST File Directories: . . Windows XP \u003d C:\u0026#92;WINDOWS\u0026#92;SYSTEM32\u0026#92;DRIVERS\u0026#92;ETC . Windows 2K \u003d C:\u0026#92;WINNT\u0026#92;SYSTEM32\u0026#92;DRIVERS\u0026#92;ETC . Win 98/ME \u003d C:\u0026#92;WINDOWS . . There is no need to turn on, adjust or change any settings. Windows automatically looks for the existence of a HOSTS file and if found, checks the HOSTS file first for entries to the web page you just requested. The 127.0.0.1 is the location of your computer, so when the entry (example) \"ad.doubleclick.net\" is requested your computer thinks 127.0.0.1 is the location of the file. When this file is not located it skips onto the next file and thus the ad server is blocked fr",
