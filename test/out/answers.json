However, few patients actually become symptomatic until their heart rate drops to less than 50 beats/minute.

      "answer": "A regular but unusually slow heart beat (60 beats/minute or less at rest). Sinus bradycardia can be the result of many things including good physical fitness, medications, and some forms of heart block. Low blood calcium makes the nervous system highly irritable with tetany (spasms of the hands and feet, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and overly active reflexes). Chronic hypocalcemia contributes to poor mineralization of bones, soft bones (osteomalacia) and osteoporosis.. What are the causes of slow heart rates? . . Abnormally slow heart rates (bradycardias) can result from diseases affecting the SA node, the conduction tissues, and the AV node. Sick sinus syndrome is a disease wherein the SA node cannot generate signals frequently enough to maintain adequate heart rate. Heart blocks are conditions where diseases (such as heart attacks) or degeneration (due to processes such as aging) of the AV node and/or the conduction tissues impair the transmission of signals from the SA node to the heart muscles.. . Some medications can cause bradycardia. Examples of these medications include calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Calan) and beta-blockers such as propanolol (Inderal) and digoxin (Lanoxin). These medications can also aggravate bradycardias in patients with existing diseases of the SA node, AV node, and other parts of the heart\u0027s conduction system.",

      "answer": "here it goes!. . In mathematics and computing, an algorithm is a procedure (a finite set of well-defined instructions) for accomplishing some task which, given an initial state, will terminate in a defined end-state. The computational complexity and efficient implementation of the algorithm are important in computing, and this depends on suitable data structures.. . Informally, the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe, although many algorithms are much more complex; algorithms often have steps that repeat (iterate) or require decisions (such as logic or comparison). In most higher level programs, algorithms act in complex patterns, each using smaller and smaller sub-methods which are built up to the program as a whole. In most languages, they are isomorphic to functions or methods.. . The concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers. The concept was formalized in 1936 through Alan Turing\u0027s Turing machines and Alonzo Church\u0027s lambda calculus, which in turn formed the foundation of computer science.. . Most algorithms can be directly implemented by computer programs; any other algorithms can at least in theory be simulated by computer programs.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm. . An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem. The word derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850. Al-Khwarizmi\u0027s work is the likely source for the word algebra as well. . A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem. . http://searchvb.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid8_gci211545,00.html. . The algorithm invitational highlights a pure skill of one\u0027s ability to solve a problem. The discovery and use of the right algorithms, and clever implementations and application are building blocks upon which the whole field takes collective steps forward. In our world of limited processors and limited storage there is a dire need for this art. It is through this remarkable skill that we can attempt unimaginable feats like decoding the human genome, routing millions of packets across networks, and even searching the entire internet. The Algorithm Invitational takes competitors through a series of brain teasers, coding challenges, and algorithmic puzzles, and seeks to engage the sharpest student minds in technology around interesting problems. http://thespoke.net/ViewContent.aspx?PostID\u003d807737. .

      "answer": "I think it is sterotyping, people of other races like Caucasians, Blacks, French Americans, Dutch Americans and so on always think Chinese and other Asians are always very good on math and science. But that is not always true, there are Asians that are not good with math and science. In my view that will come in the area with some that are Amecican Born Asians, not those that are born in Hong Kong, China, Philippines, India, Vietnam, Japan, Laso, Korea and so on, and immergrated to America. I\u0027m ABC and math and science are not my best area. When I was in middle school and high school , I had to take Special Ed math class, in that department they did not even have levels beyond basic math,so there was no special ed math classes that are peralgebra, algebra and so on. It was not just that, I was also in Special Ed english class. The race that you see alot more in Special Ed classes are Blacks. Asians and Caucasians are tired with the same amount being in those classes and having a Special Ed counselor. My friends who are also ABC that was with in those classes in high school, but with different Special Ed counselor, in their last year of high school, their counselor put them in aa ESL class like Civcs/Econ. Sometime  a Special Ed counselor do put a student in non special Classes when they think they are good enough or should give it a try, like higher level high school math. Once a student has Special Ed counselor it stays with them. In order for any student to be in this type classes and have regular counselor, it doesn\u0027t just appear one day saying you need it. I thinke like daring 1st-5th grade, sometime then there are testings are done, and maybe a regular test the whole school takes does not come out so good that would ask for those kind of testing to see.So not all Asians can be automatically label Asians as smart. Also can\u0027t always sterotype Asians as very good in Math and science. Because not all Asians major in an area of science that will take them to working for a biotech company, or Civil Engineering. Some Asians like to major major in Econ, Computer Science, Public Health, Lawyer(business, immergation), accounting(motsly HKers, as most ABC sees it), business(hospitality, MIS), Computer Engineering, creative writing, animation, the major that will bring them to working in the crime lab and other stuff.  .   On another thing Asians are always used as \"Model Minority\" by other races and it is always saying how Asians make it without any help here in America why can\u0027t you do that. I don\u0027t know and can\u0027t remember which race or races do that. So for me Math and Science are not my strong points, but I don\u0027t hate them at all..   If you like know about sterotyping Asians, the \"Model Minority\", Occupation Ghettolisasion and other thing you should take a Asian American Studies class at your local college. At CCSF there is a Asian American Studies class called ASAM 20 Asian Amer Exprnc Since 1820, that is the class I took and it will tell you all those stuff and other things, it a good class.",

      "answer": "Sales and marketing are totally different. To succeed in today’s marketplace, it is critical that you have a clear understanding of the difference or I guarantee you it will cost you, and cost you big..  . What’s the Difference? .  Sales is what you do when you are one on one with a prospect. Sales is the scripts you say, the techniques you use to drive home a point or persuade a person to write an offer or to sign a listing contract. You read a prospect’s buying signs, then adjust your response to the prospect and the situation.. . Understanding the difference between sales and marketing is essential to effective lead generation, and Greg’s expertise on this subject can be a tremendous asset to your career. . . Sales.  . Most agents are well trained in one-on-one selling. They memorize the scripts; if a prospect says “x”, then they respond with “y”. Agents are taught to focus on the customer’s needs, sell the benefits, ask “yes” questions, send up trial closes and then make sure to close at least five times; if they still have not signed, go back and start over with more benefits. This is the classic sales mentality that most agents have been indoctrinated with. Agents spend countless hours learning, practicing and perfecting their sales skills. . Once agents start to feel confident in their sales skills, they start looking at everyone as a potential prospect. They start to believe that if they are a good enough sales person, they can sell anything to anyone. I remember reading an old sales book that said, “a great sales person could convince people to buy things that they never heard of, never wanted, would never use, yet still make a prospect feel like they had made a wise decision to buy.” I constantly run into agents that with great pride tell me that they have a 90% or 95% closing ratio. This is all fine and good. Having great sales skills gives you a powerful advantage in the marketplace. The problem I see is when an agent’s sales mentality starts to creep into their marketing materials..  . Marketing, Defined .  Marketing is what you do to attract prospects before you meet them face-to-face. Marketing is stimulating a prospect’s interest and desire so that they what to buy in the first place. Personal marketing is not only stimulating interest, it is doing it in a way that makes the prospect want to buy through you. Great personal marketing creates a steady flow of people who are interested in working with you, so that when they call you they are already predisposed to working with you.. . The key difference you must understand is this: what makes a great one-on-one sales presentation is not the same thing you can use to make great marketing materials. So many agents take their very effective one-on-one presentation, put it on paper and call it marketing. Marketing starts by reaching out and grabbing a prospect’s attention by capturing a reader’s imagination. This is best done with a strong, emotional appeal that draws a reader along, getting them to imagine what it would by like to have a new home.. . Think about this way: What if a guy decided he wanted to get married, so he developed a list of all the benefits he had to offer a prospective wife? He then wrote that list of benefits on paper and sent it out to 1,000 single women. What kind of response do you think he would get? This is like putting a sales presentation on paper and calling it marketing. It simply does not work. Marketing is an attraction process that creates interest that gets a steady flow of dates coming your way. Not everyone is a perfect fit, but when you have a steady flow of new prospects coming your way, your chances of success go up significantly. .  . What to Do? .  So, you have come to the realization that you have been using too many sales pitches in your marketing materials. What now? . Start by just looking at your marketing materials. Do they look great? When you’re looking good, you attract more atten",

      "answer": "Westerners will definitely find life in Saudi Arabia shocking. The guys mentioned enough about women not driving cars or the absence of churches (in public). . . Let me add this, Saudi Arabia is under major reconstruction project, in all aspects from down to top. Laws will all be changed to comply with the plan especially after approving the tourist visas. . . Westerners are most welcome in Saudi Arabia and they can feel the hospitality in everywhere they go.  The average stay for a westerner in Saudi Arabia is from 10-15 years!, and we just said good bye to 25-year worker in the company !.  . . The reasons to come to Saudi Arabia can\u0027t go out of: Work/Business , Stop Over or Visit to the Islamic holy places (if you\u0027re Muslim).  In my opinion, It\u0027s not a place to settle, it\u0027s a place to plan your retirement by working hard and saving money. Westerners have the higher salaries in all companies here (I\u0027m working in Salary Planning !!).. . Talking about what so called Wahabi Police which we call them a religious police or \"Mutawa\u0027\".  First of all, they are not police, they are a government group who monitor abuse or offensive behavior in public places especially toward women.  Now, they\u0027re not even on the streets since they see everything through the hanging camers here and there !!  I think they shouldn\u0027t be a problem.. . To summarize, remember this:. . -In every public place in Saudi Arabia, there is Single Section \u0026 Family/Single Women Section. . . -There are no bars or discos there and liquors are not sold (in public).. . -Women don\u0027t drive (except inside some company camps) and all women should wear \"Abayah\" or the black cover which is basically like a robe (no comes in many designs and styles that became a fashion !). You don\u0027t have cover head.  . Another thing, you would find the Saudi traditional cloths funny !! well, just bare with it!. . -Please, don\u0027t look at every Saudi as he is ready to blow you away!!. From the first day, you\u0027d be amazed how naive and kind Saudi people are.. . -Most police man here don\u0027t know much of English. When you have a problem as a local to help you translate.. .

      "answer": "This question is both consequential and abiguous.  On the one hand it is considered a great philisophical question, and requires considerable input to give an adequate description.   Of course, many persons like to give flippant answers because they would prefer to not think that life has a purpose, therefore of no consequence as to how they live.   .     Lets however assume for a moment, that you really are seeking a coherent answer to one of the ancient questions, which has been debated throughout the centuries by able thinkers.     Life, would require purpose to have meaning.  To recind any life with out so much as a casual consideration would indicate that life has little meaning for such a person.   .     Yesterday,  I was brought to the point of consideration of the life of a Robin.   Some how, a Robin was struck senseless, fell to the ground and as I was walking along, found the little creature, trying valiantly to right itself,,weakly flapping its  wings.   I approached slowly,  wrapped the obviously injured bird in a napkin to prevent it from thrashing about,,,and considered the situation... here was a life, that had purpose.  Somewhere, its mate was probably sitting a nest,  and now,  would be faced with a task of feeding chicks by itself.  No small task.  A life of meaning, in its purpose of being a Robin.    This little Robin, is no less a creature of meaningful purpose than we humans.   It could not ask any such questions about what life means, but I could and do.  You do also.   .      I can thus respond in this manner.   I find life to have meaning in knowing that GOD created each of us for the purpose of being part of the Grand Fellowship of all creatures and that we bring GOD pleasure when we serve GOD in a careing and helping manner of life.   The world is often viewed as a dark and dreary place full of casual relationship or worse, evil and wickedness and hurting,  but this world also is the place where even the smallest act of care, brings light.   The smallest child can bring a smile to the face of an scarred warrior,  and a grandchild brings warm thoughts to the elderly folk.    Love brings light into a dark world,  and that is what I believe we are here for.  TO bring light into the Dark, which will eventually be consumed as the dark of this world is lit by love.    Does this mean life is a challenge?  Absolutely.   The wickedness of the animal characteristic of humanity will however, be eventually brought into the realm of peace,  at least I believe it to be so,  and the Prophet Isaiah, declares,,,that the lion will some day lie down with the lamb.  Thats the similie of the wild beast of humanity being brought into corelationship with the gentler nature.    May it come soon.  Shalom.   Sincerely",

Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.

      "answer": "the smallest component of an element having the chemical properties of the element . . is the smallest possible particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical properties. The word atom originally meant the smallest possible indivisible particle, but after the term came to have a specific meaning in science, atoms were found to be divisible and composed of smaller subatomic particles.. . Most atoms are composed of three types of subatomic particles which govern their external properties:. . electrons, which have a negative charge and are the least massive of the three; . protons, which have a positive charge and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and . neutrons, which have no charge and are about 1839 times more massive than electrons. . Protons and neutrons make up a dense, massive atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The electrons form the much larger electron cloud surrounding the nucleus.. . Atoms differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. The number of protons in an atom (called the atomic number) determines the element of the atom. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may also vary, determining the isotope of that element. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus may also change, via nuclear fusion, nuclear fission or radioactive decay. The number of electrons associated with an atom is most easily changed, due to the lower energy of binding of electrons.. . Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic crystals. Molecules are the smallest division of a general collection of matter, including chemical compounds, which retains chemical properties. Most molecules are made up of multiple atoms; for example, a molecule of water is a combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. A few types of molecules (for example gas molecules of elements that do not form compounds, such as helium) are composed of only a single atom.. . Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry, and are conserved in chemical reactions",

It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that isn\u0027t really a mystery.. . The term \"Bermuda Triangle\" was first used in an article written by Vincent H. Gaddis for Argosy magazine in 1964. In the article Gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation. Gaddis wasn\u0027t the first one to come to this conclusion, either. As early as 1952 George X. Sands, in a report in Fate magazine, noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region.. . In 1969 John Wallace Spencer wrote a book called Limbo of the Lost specifically about the triangle and, two years later, a feature documentary on the subject, The Devil\u0027s Triangle, was released. These, along with the bestseller The Bermuda Triangle, published in 1974, permanently registered the legend of the \"Hoodoo Sea\" within popular culture.. . Several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent, technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea.. . The only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality. In 1975 a librarian at Arizona State University, named Larry Kusche, decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books. What he found he published in his own book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved. Kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected. He found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all. Often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in \"calms seas\" when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress. Others said ships had \"mysteriously vanished\" when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained.. ... more",

While trying to be aware of your dream state and by recognizing during any dream that you are indeed dreaming, then you will gradually learn to feel safe in knowing there is no limits in that state as in real life . By involving your awareness of the state your in, you can learn to control the action or activity in your dream, as well as the paths and makeup of the scenarios you conjure up. To master these tricks you have to train yourself to recognize and consciously admit to yourself that you are dreaming and that you can do anything you wish with no consequences in that dream. When you master this you will be able to go places and do things, like fly, feel love, feel sex, release stress and tensions, feel belonging or a sense of presence while feeling strong by conquering fears, frustrations, and inhibitions etc.. Lucid dreaming can make the dream go anyway you wish it to go in order to release frustration or any experience you wouldn?t normally be able to do in real life. You also have access to some incredible creative thinking in this processes, which can be utilized to create new concepts and discoveries.. Some of my best creative works and incredible ideas and revelations have come through a mixture of Lucid State and Conscious State. I believe this is because your lucid dream state uses parts of the brain usually dormant and not used to resource processing. The conscious state is one that does analytical thinking, so the power of the two combined or perhaps the different train of thinking and processing might tap into parts of the brain you never knew to function before. It\u0027s just a theory, so I\u0027ll have to sleep on it and let my mind ponder it to see if it\u0027s true. *S*. Best time to control dreams:. *Note Many say when you are falling in and out of sleep at night is a great time to control dreams but even in the morning before waking fully up your in that in between concious and sleep state whereby your conciously waking up and conciously intending on falling back asleep which is perfect for controling dreams, because your awake enough to think about what you want to envision and concious of your sleep while at the same time ready to go back under.. I project that within 10-20 years we will be able to control what we dream by way of computer interaction, either by wireless frequency or direct impulse stimulation or connections. (so one day you will be trading real feel virtual reality discs with your neighbors and friends.) Don\u0027t be shocked when this leads to and becomes part of our waking conscious reality. When the virtual reality will be felt like it\u0027s the real deal. Total enjoyment of life without the consequences. Utopia!  . First you need to learn what dreams are and what they can or can not mean. Start by reading all the pages in the first link I have provided below.. Next I want you to do the following excersises:. Exercise. .     Now listen very carefully.  I want you to imagine a bright white light coming down from above and entering the top of your head.    Filling you entire body.

See it, feel it and it becomes reality.  Now only your master and guides and highly evolved loving entities who mean you well will be able to influence you during this or any other hypnotic session.   You are totally protected by this aura of pure white light.. . * PLAY NEW AGE MUSIC FOR 1 MINUTE. .    Imagine that your physical body is a honeycomb.

Gametes (Egg \u0026 Sperm) are created from different cells through meiosis. Only a mutation of a gamete itself could be passed onto offspring. Also most mutations in cells result in that cells death and so the mutation is not passed on.

      "answer": "The most obvious reason for outsourcing of manufacturing jobs is the reduction in labor cost.  This allows consumers to purchase lower priced products due to reduced labor costs.  However, all manufacturing jobs are not being lost to outsourcing.  American manufacturing jobs are often reduced as a result of our own improved efficiency.  If a company can automate a manufacturing process or reduce the needed labor to a minimum, there is little difference in the cost to produce a product.  Secondly, we now live in what has become a global economy.  Since other countries are developing, the need for manufactured goods has increased overseas.  American companies want to be there to capitalize on overseas development.  This means that a lot of the goods being produced are not making it back to the US, but being sold in the foreign markets where they are produced.  To answer your question, it is not a plot against the middle class, but a consequence of developing countries and a global economy.  If people did not care to pay more for an American made product rather than base decisions on price and quality the problem would be reduced, but problems would arise with the US products not being competitive on the global market.  Just look at the automotive market, foreign automakers are thriving in the US with the products that are being produced in the US, while American automakers are struggling building cars that contain mainly Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese parts.  So, maybe part of it is the fact that American companies are now being forced to manage themselves better, where before the competition of foreign manufacturers was not there.

I am dead proud to be Chinese, but I\u0027m not yellow so how can I be proud that I am Yellow?. I\u0027m Brown if you want to go into specifics.. . Moreover, one must also take note that Asia is made out of East, South and Southeast Asia.

I love extreme sports and I\u0027m under the sun 24/7, so I\u0027m definitely not yellow or white or fair.. . But I do suggest you take a look at Asian American History, which is what I am doing right now and read about acts like the Chinese Exclusion Acts etc. I don\u0027t deny many Chinese don\u0027t like to be labelled Yellow but I think it also stems from the perpetuate stereotypes behind the label Yellow. . . On the other hand, there ARE Chinese who are PROUD to be Yellow.

In 1553 ,we have Thomas Becon, in \u0027The relikes of Rome\u0027:. . \"All is not golde that glistereth.\". . Shakespeare is the most well-known use of the idea. His version is sometimes transcribed as \u0027all that glisters is not gold\u0027. From The Merchant of Venice:. . . MOROCCO:. O hell! what have we here?. A carrion Death, within whose empty eye. There is a written scroll! I\u0027ll read the writing.. All that glitters is not gold;. Often have you heard that told:. Many a man his life hath sold. But my outside to behold:. Gilded tombs do worms enfold.. Had you been as wise as bold,. Young in limbs, in judgment old,. Your answer had not been inscroll\u0027d:. Fare you well; your suit is cold.. Cold, indeed; and labour lost:. Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!. Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart. To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.. The Saying: ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. . . Who Said It: Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra . . When: 1615 . . The Story behind It: In Part II of Cervantes\u0027s satire Don Quixote, Sancho Panza uses this gold aphorism while speaking to the duchess. His speech, in part, reads: \"...if you don\u0027t think fit to give me an island because I am a fool, I\u0027ll be so wise as not to care whether you do or not. \u0027Tis an old saying, the Devil lurks behind the cross. All is not gold that glisters.\" While Cervantes\u0027s phrasing is quite close to the accepted version, \"All that glitters is not gold,\" it is impossible to determine where the idea originated. As far back as the 12th century, a French philosopher and theologian, Alain de Lille, wrote, \"Do not hold everything gold that shines like gold.\" Both Chaucer (in The House of Fame, c. 1383) and Shakespeare (in The Merchant of Venice, 1596) had versions of the aphorism. John Dryden first used the word glitters, in his poem The Hind and the Panther (1687). The line reads, \"All, as they say, that glitters is not gold.\"",

(The saying, by the way, goes back at least to 1300, and was popularized in Cervantes\u0027 Don Quixote in 1605.). . The meaning:. The explanation is NOT that the ingredients or process don\u0027t matter (so long as it tastes good?) and certainly not that \u0027the ends justify the means\u0027.  The emphasis is in a very different direction.  \"Proof\" here has its older sense of \"test\" and the point is that you should not simply believe something is right and in order UNTIL you\u0027ve put it to the test.. . \"The proverb literally says that you won’t know whether food has been cooked properly until you try it. Or, putting it figuratively, don’t assume that something is in order or believe what you are told, but judge the matter by testing it; it’s much the same philosophy as in \u0027seeing is believing\u0027 and \u0027actions speak louder than words\u0027.\". http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pro1.htm",

      "answer": "The Sandwich .  WHO COOKED THAT UP?. J.J. wonders. .  The origin of the name \"sandwich\" reminds me of a favorite riddle of my brother\u0027s when he was about seven or eight years old. . . \"If you were stranded on a desert island, what would you eat?\" . The answer: \"The sand which is there.\" . . Although the sandwich has nothing to do with sand, it still has a vague connection with island life, because the Hawai\u0027ian Islands were once called \"The Sandwich Islands.\"  They were named for the very same person for whom the sandwich that we eat was named, John Montagu (1718-1792), the Fourth Earl of Sandwich. . . The Earl was the patron of Captain James Cook (the explorer who discovered the Hawai\u0027ian Islands) and, because he was also the First Lord of the Admiralty during the American revolutionary war, he has sometimes been blamed by the British for the loss of the American Colonies.  There is a story that he was an enthusiastic gambler and when he didn\u0027t wish to leave the gaming table -- or possibly just his desk -- to go to dinner he would ask for someone to bring him some meat between a couple of slices of bread.  Later, when others began asking for the same thing, they would say something like, \"I\u0027ll have what Sandwich is having...\"  Obviously it caught on, and people just started calling for \"a Sandwich\" when they wanted meat between two slices of bread.  The word sandwich is therefore an eponym -- a word or phrase whose origin is a person or historical figure. . . If the English claim to have invented the sandwich, the French disagree, saying that long before the word sandwich came into use, it was common for workers in the field and those going on a journey to take with them meat or fish between two slices of black bread. . . Today the Americans in particular pile their sandwiches high with more than just meat or fish.  Stacked sandwiches may be said to have begun with the \"Dagwood,\" named for Dagwood Bumstead, the husband of the title character in Chic Young\u0027s comic strip, \"Blondie.\"   Another kind of stacked sandwich is made in long rolls rather than square bread slices, and they are called variously \"submarines,\" \"poor boys,\" \"heroes,\" and \"hoagies.\" . . The grilled cheese sandwich might be said to be a variation of a French recipe, the \"Croque Monsieur,\" which has been around since early in the 20th century.   According to the Larousse Gastronomique it is made by taking two slices of bread, buttered on one side only, with ham and cheese in the center, and frying the sandwich in clarified butter.  Today it is often broiled with bechamel sauce on top.  A \"Croque Madame\" is topped with a fried egg.  Some say that the grilled cheese sandwich was further refined in San Francisco in the 1950\u0027s into what is called the \"Monte Cristo.\" It is made by placing slices of swiss or gruyere cheese, ham and turkey between two slices of white bread, then dipped in an egg and milk batter, fried in butter, and served with a spoonful of currant jelly on the side. . . The ingredients of a Club Sandwich can vary slightly from place to place, but it is invariably a three decker sandwich of toasted bread, with one layer of filling devoted to meat -- ham and/or turkey, possibly adding slices of crisp bacon -- and the other layer devoted to salad ingredients -- lettuce, tomato, avocado and/or onion slices.  The origin of the name Club is thought to be either from the restaurant menu in a Country Club or from the snack bar service in a Club Car of one of the special trains that traveled from New York to Chicago in the 1930\u0027s and 1940\u0027s.",

Football is called Soccer because Soccer did not become a big sport here until long after Football (sometimes called American Football) had made its nitch. Some people do still call pants trousers...knickers are a form of short legged pant here...the word Sneaker comes from the fact that you can walk quietly in tennis shoes and here, in America, a chemist is different from a pharmacist and so a pharmacist who specializes in medications and drugs works in a drugstore (or today in KMart, Walmart, etc.). . I hope that helps",

      "answer": "The Benefits of Eating Broccoli. . Preliminary lab studies of monkey and human cells conducted by researchers at the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in Rootstown, Ohio show that a compound found naturally in broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts-- indole-3-carbinol--may be a key to inhibiting the herpes simplex virus. And it works really well. The compound blocked the virus from reproducing by an amazing 99.9 percent--essentially 100 percent effectiveness. . . The indole-3-carbinol compound works by interfering with factors that help cells reproduce. It inhibits the herpes simplex virus in the same way, since the virus needs those same factors as the cells to reproduce.. . Herpes differs markedly from other viruses. Once a person contracts it, the virus lives in the body for a lifetime. The American Social Health Association estimates that as many as 80 percent of adults in the United States have oral herpes, while 20 percent have genital herpes. Fully 90 percent are unaware they have the virus. There is no cure.. . While this research news is promising, caution is advised until further studies are done. What works in the lab doesn\u0027t always work on humans in the real world. Still, eating more broccoli is a good idea not only to prevent herpes, but also to possibly ward off cancer, cataracts, and stroke.. . The research findings were presented to the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. . . . Stopping Breast Cancer Cold. . Researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have determined that a compound found in broccoli and Brussels sprouts, called sulforaphane, hinders the growth of human breast cancer cells in the laboratory.. . This magic bullet worked by disrupting the action of protein \"microtubules\" within the cancer cells, which are vital for the success of cell division and growth. What is most intriguing about this finding is that certain cancer drugs work in a similar way. That means it\u0027s quite possible that sulforaphane could be used in combination with other compounds or drugs to prevent and treat cancer.. . This isn\u0027t the first time scientists have shown sulforaphane helps prevent cancer. Previous research has also proven that the compound blocks the formation of breast tumors in rats, and it can even force colon cancer cells to commit cell suicide. It seems that sulforaphane works its magic on the detoxification enzymes that try to defend the cancer-promoting substances.. . This latest research suggests there is a new mechanism for sulforaphane to battle cancer cells called microtubule disruption. And that is what co-study author Dr. Keith Singletary, a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois, finds most intriguing since microtubule disruption is exactly how certain types of cancer drugs work. What if those cancer drugs were combined with sulforaphane to work in combination for an even more powerful effect?. . So the big question remains: If you eat a diet that is rich in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, broccoli sprouts, and other sulforaphane-containing foods, will your risk for developing breast cancer decrease? Scientists aren\u0027t ready to say that. However, numerous studies have linked a diet that is rich in vegetables and fruits to a lower risk of cancer, including breast cancer. What still is not known is which specific vegetables work best for preventing cancer.. . That said, it won\u0027t hurt you to load up on broccoli, and it may very well be a lifesaving side dish you enjoy with dinner tonight",
